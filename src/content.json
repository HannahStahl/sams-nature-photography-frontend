    "Growing up, I had a negative opinion of photography, seeing it as an impediment to living in the moment. It always looked to me like photographers were experiencing the world filtered through a tiny viewfinder or screen instead of with their own eyes. More recently, I've come to see photography as a way of finding and seeking out moments instead, while actually enhancing my experiences. Photography is also my way of documenting the beautiful places and animals I see traveling or just in the places I've been lucky enough to live in and see while running, biking, skiing, and just plain wandering through the hills. A journal of sorts for a non-writer.",
    "I also appreciate that photography has taught me a lot about our human impact on the world. I am a big believer in not geo-tagging on instagram and not sharing specific locations, as popular places tend to get overrun by people who are not always respectful of other people's right to enjoy wild places, let alone \"details\" like leave no trace principles, local rules and laws, etc. Also, where's the fun in exploring and finding a cool spot if someone just geo-tagged it for you? With wildlife photography too, I've learned about how just my presence can affect an animal's behavior in ways that aren't positive or natural.",
    "I'm a shameless weekend warrior with a day job, but I do take pride in trying to visit and photograph lesser known, but equally beautiful places beyond the icons (in most cases), paved roads, and crowds while being as cognizant of my impact on those places as much as possible."
